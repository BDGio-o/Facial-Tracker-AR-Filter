# Facial-Tracker-AR-Filter
Here is a facial/Hand tracker, it draws a box around your head and facial landmarks using OpenCV and mediapipe libraries, i have also added some accessories that attach to you as a filter, as of right now all you can move are the glasses , just pinch them and you can move them around on your face or off
